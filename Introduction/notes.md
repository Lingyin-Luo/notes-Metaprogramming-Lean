**reflection**

* > The compiler: parse the code, build an abstract syntax tree, then elaborate the syntax node into terms which could be processed by the Lean kernel.
  > meta-level : those activities done by the compiler
  > object-level : the common usage of the language syntax

* > One can wirte notation to initiate a term of a certain type and use it right away in the same file. This concept is generally called _reflection_.
  > We can say that, in Lean, the meta-level is reflected to the object-level.
